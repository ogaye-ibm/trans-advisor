AGENDA

  2. RUN t-WAS (FROM DOCKER IF NO WAS AVAILABLE)

========================================

APP MOD WITH TA, DEVELOPER'S STEPS:
    1. The developer downloads a custom data collector from TA.
    2. The developer runs the data collector on the traditional WebSphere Application Server host.
    3. Data collector analysis is uploaded (automatically or manually) to TA.
    4. The developer reviews recommendations in TA and creates a migration bundle.
    5. The developer downloads the migration bundle (or push it to a git repo).
    6. The developer either: 
        option 1: uses Docker to build an image and upload it to a registry (e.g.; IBM icr).
                  then uses a generated Helm chart to deploy the modernized app as a containerized Liberty app on OCP
        option 2: or use an OCP pipeline (tekton, jenkins) to pull from the git repo and deploy to OCP
